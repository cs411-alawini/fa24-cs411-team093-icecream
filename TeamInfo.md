## Project Summary

# Fantasy Research Assistant

We aim to build a web application that assists NFL Fantasy players in making a data driven decision about their NFL Fantasy Team and tracking their team. The problem we are trying to solve is that there is a lot of data that a fantasy player needs to consume, process, and analyze to make an informed decision on selecting players/team performance, and information. We want to simplify the process for users to be able to compare players, teams, and calculate statistics that they can use for their fantasy game. We also want a user to be able to input their team and track players so that they can track their progress. We want to include a feature to run analytics on the users current roster to see what areas they are struggling and track their progress.
